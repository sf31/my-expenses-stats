A simple web app for visualizing and analyzing your expenses/incomes using data in CSV format.


# Usage

This app does not rely on any backend, your files are stored locally in your browser.

It requires a CSV file with the following header:

```
Split transaction; Date; Payee/Payer; Income; Expense; Category; Subcategory; Notes; Payment method;
```

This header is based on output from the [MyExpenses](https://github.com/mtotschnig/MyExpenses) application.
